KD8CEC supports dual 16x2 LCD monitors connected via I2C. You get more information, however, the mechanics of the 16x2 LCD's prevents close mounting. This frame was the closest that I could think of to mount them.

You will need to print a frame and two frame clips. I used small M3 screws and nuts to attach the frame clips to the frame.
