#uBITX Experimenters Base

The goal of this design is to allow easy access to a uBITX while providing a secure platform to actually work the radio. I created this design because I needed to swap out Raduinos and displays (specifically LCD's) quickly. This design includes spots (on left) for 2 daughter boards that I designed to provid a dual 5v power supply and a platform for the Nano used by KD8CEC to monitor S-meter, SWR, decode CW, etc.

This design is made up of
- base-unit	This is a big item and might not fit on smaller 3d printers
- lcd-frames	Various bezels and support structures for 16x2,dual 16x2 and 20x4 LCD
- speaker-grill	And yes, I have poked holes in speakers before reaching around...
- raduino-rack	Not part of the design, but my OCD got the better of me and I designed something to hold all the Raduinos I would be swapping...
