The rear panel was modified from a Thingiverse item:

I used a rear panel connector that is a little different than the typical plug and panel type because I wanted to have more flexibility in the usb connector that was used on the processor (sometimes they are micro, sometimes they are mini, sometimes they are usb-c). This one allow me to just order short cables for each type and install them when I switched processors.
