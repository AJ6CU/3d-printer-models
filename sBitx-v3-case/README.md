# A 3d printable case for the HF Signals sBitx board

## Revision History
Jan 21, 2024:	Initial v1

## Overview
This is a design for a 3d printable case for the HF Signals sBITX. Hams that have just purchased the single motherboard might find this design useful. To print it, you will need a 3d printer with at least 270mm x 170mm bed. If you do not have such a large printer, there are multiple 3d printing services that can print it for you. Unfortunately, I do not offer such a service. 

I printed in petg. With 50% infil, it will take approximately 8-10 hours to print all the pieces. I did not need to use any supports (although some screw holes came out somewhat oval...

3mm screws are used everywhere. Depending on your printer, you may need to pre-tap some of the holes. 

This was designed using Fusion 360. My thanks go out to Mike - KW1ND that provided the base design from which I started. It would have been much more difficult to have started from scratch.

## Assembly
### Step 1: Print all pieces. 
You need to print all the parts. Make sure you print 2x of the lcd brace.

## Known Problems
1. Holes for RaspberryPi connectors (USB and RJ45) are high by about 1-2 mm. 
2. No holes provided to attach speaker.
